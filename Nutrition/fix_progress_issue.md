# 🔧 Fix Progress Data Issue

## Problem Identified
The backend is working correctly (200 calories logged for `test_user`), but the Flutter app isn't showing the data. Here are the most likely causes and solutions:

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Username in Flutter App
The Flutter app might be using a different username. Check what username is being used:

**In your Flutter app, look for:**
- Login screen - what username/email are you using?
- Check the home screen - what username is passed to the progress screen?

### 2. Clear Flutter App Cache
The Flutter app might be using cached data. Try:

1. **Hot Restart** the Flutter app (not just hot reload)
2. **Clear app data** and restart
3. **Pull to refresh** on the progress screen

### 3. Check API Connection
Make sure the Flutter app can reach the backend:

**Test the connection:**
```bash
# From your computer, test if the API is reachable
curl http://192.168.1.8:5000/progress/daily-summary?user=YOUR_USERNAME
```

### 4. Add Debug Logging
I've added debug logging to the progress service. Check the Flutter console for:

```
🔄 Fetching progress data for [username] - daily
📅 Date range: [start] to [end]
📊 Backend data received:
   Calories: [number] entries
   Weight: [number] entries
   Workouts: [number] entries
📊 Progress data loaded:
   Calories: [current]/[goal]
   Steps: [current]/[goal]
   Exercise: [duration] min
   Water: [current]/[goal]
```

## 🚀 Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Force Refresh
Add this to your Flutter app to force refresh the progress data:

```dart
// In your progress screen, add a refresh button
FloatingActionButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    await _loadProgressData(forceRefresh: true);
  },
  child: Icon(Icons.refresh),
)
```

### Fix 2: Check Username
Make sure you're using the same username in both:
- Food logging
- Progress screen

### Fix 3: Test with Known Data
Log some food with a specific username, then check the progress screen with the same username.

## 🧪 Test Commands

Run these to verify your setup:

```bash
# 1. Test backend is working
python test_progress_integration.py

# 2. Test specific user data
python debug_progress_issue.py

# 3. Check if Flutter can reach backend
# (Run this from your Flutter app directory)
flutter run --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://192.168.1.8:5000
```

## 📱 Flutter App Debugging

1. **Check the console output** when you open the progress screen
2. **Look for error messages** in the Flutter debug console
3. **Try different time ranges** (Daily/Weekly/Monthly)
4. **Pull to refresh** the progress screen

## ✅ Expected Behavior

When working correctly, you should see:
- Progress cards showing actual calorie data
- Insights based on your progress
- Real-time updates when you log food

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

If the issue persists:

1. **Check the Flutter console** for any error messages
2. **Verify the username** being used in the app
3. **Test the API directly** with your username
4. **Try logging food** and immediately checking progress

The backend is definitely working - we just need to make sure the Flutter app is connecting properly!
