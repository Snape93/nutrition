# ðŸ”— **Redmi Watch 5 Active Integration Guide**
*Connect your Redmi Watch to our Nutrition App via Google Fit*

## ðŸŽ¯ **How It Works**

We've implemented the **Google Fit Bridge** approach used by major apps like MyFitnessPal, Strava, and Samsung Health:

```
Redmi Watch 5 Active â†’ Mi Fitness â†’ Google Fit â†’ Our Nutrition App
```

This is **much more reliable** than Health Connect (90% vs 15% success rate)!
