## 4. Research Paradigm

### 4.1 Positivist Approach
- **Objective Reality**: Nutrition facts and health metrics
- **Quantitative Data**: Calorie counts, weight measurements, usage statistics
- **Causal Relationships**: Input → Process → Output relationships
- **Generalizable Results**: Applicable to broader user populations

### 4.2 Interpretivist Approach
- **Subjective Experience**: User perceptions and experiences
- **Qualitative Data**: User feedback, behavior patterns, preferences
- **Contextual Understanding**: Individual user contexts and motivations
- **Personalized Insights**: Tailored recommendations and experiences

## 5. Conceptual Relationships

### 5.1 Direct Relationships
1. **User Input → System Processing**: User data directly influences app functionality
2. **System Output → User Behavior**: App recommendations affect user actions
3. **Feedback → System Adaptation**: User responses modify system behavior

### 5.2 Moderating Relationships
1. **User Engagement**: Affects the strength of input-output relationships
2. **Data Quality**: Influences the accuracy of system recommendations
3. **Technology Literacy**: Impacts user adoption and effective usage

### 5.3 Mediating Relationships
1. **Personalization Engine**: Mediates between user input and system output
2. **Learning Algorithm**: Mediates between user behavior and system adaptation
3. **Feedback Mechanisms**: Mediate between system output and user input
